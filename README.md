This is a repository for my USACO projects. Each project has it's own folder under the src folder.
There is a ".in" and ".out" file in the main directory, These file's names change depending on what
problem you want to run. Take the name of the class that you are trying to run and change the said ".in"
and ".out" files to match the name. For example: "ride.java" => "ride.in" "ride.out" or "test.java" =>
"test.in" "test.out"
