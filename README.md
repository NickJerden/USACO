This is a repository for my USACO projects. Each project has it's own folder under the src folder.
There is a ".in" and ".out" file in the main directory, These file's names change depending on what
problem you want to run. Take the name of the class that you are trying to run and change the said ".in"
and ".out" files to match the name. For example: "ride.java" => "ride.in" "ride.out" or "test.java" =>
"test.in" "test.out"


"Working on machine; Broken on USACO grader" means the program does not pass all test cases, on the one on
my local computer. "In progress" means that the program is not complete, and will be followed by a "pt."(part)
to show which version of the program it is
